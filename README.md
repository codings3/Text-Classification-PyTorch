# Text-Classification-PyTorch
"PyTorch-based text classification model with synthetic data, evaluation, and visualization."
# Text Classification Using PyTorch (Google Colab)

This project is a beginner-friendly text classification model built using PyTorch. It classifies text data into categories using a simple neural network model.

## Features
✅ Synthetic dataset generation  
✅ PyTorch-based text classification model  
✅ Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall  
✅ Visualizations for better understanding  

## How to Run
1. Open the Colab notebook link:   
2. Click **"Run All"** from the **Runtime** menu.  
3. The notebook will display model training, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.

## Requirements
- PyTorch  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib  

These libraries are pre-installed in Colab.
